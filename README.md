# Linked Lists

In Computer Science one of the most basic and fundamental data structures is the linked list, which functions similarly to an array. The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation of any other elements.

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that "point" to the next node by means of a pointer. Each node holds a single element of data and a link or pointer to the next node in the list. A head node is the first node in the list, a tail node is the last node in the list.
